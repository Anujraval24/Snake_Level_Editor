# Snake_Level_Editor (WIP)
A tile editor for my game.
It is working but still some of the features are not implemented such as using custom sprites with different sizes.<br>
<b>Different texture sizes are supported but, you would have to manually edit cfg file to define your coordinates as per your source image.</b>
